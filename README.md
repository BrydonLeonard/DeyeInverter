# DeyeInverter
Small utility to read data from DEYE Inverters through the Solarman Datalogger. Works with S/N 17*

Thanks to @fjcarretero https://github.com/fjcarretero for his incredible support on understanding the data from and to the datalogger.
Thanks to @xtheone https://github.com/XtheOne for his original V4 reader that was an inspiration (and I borrowed *some* code).
